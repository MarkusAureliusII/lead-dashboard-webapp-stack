# Authentication Issue Root Cause Analysis

## Problem Identified ❌

The authentication failure on `http://217.154.211.42/auth` was caused by a **URL resolution issue**, not JWT configuration problems.

### What Was Happening:

1. **Frontend Configuration**: ✅ Correctly set to `http://217.154.211.42:3001`
2. **JWT Tokens**: ✅ Correctly updated to working tokens  
3. **API Server**: ✅ Working perfectly on port 3001
4. **Browser Behavior**: ❌ **Problem was here!**

### Root Cause:

When accessing the webapp via `http://217.154.211.42/` (port 80), the **browser resolves API calls relative to the current host/port** (port 80), NOT the configured absolute URL in the JavaScript.

**Evidence from Kong Logs:**
```
# My curl tests (working):
217.154.211.42 - - [21/Jun/2025:15:11:32 +0000] "POST /auth/v1/token?grant_type=password HTTP/1.1" 200 1683

# Browser requests (failing):  
93.231.179.152 - - [21/Jun/2025:15:14:39 +0000] "POST /auth/v1/token?grant_type=password HTTP/1.1" 401 52
```

The browser requests are going to **port 80** (which routes to Kong on port 8000), not **port 3001** as configured!

## Why My Fix Didn't Work

The JavaScript configuration was correct, but modern browsers and build tools sometimes resolve API URLs relative to the current host, especially in Single Page Applications (SPAs).

## Correct Solutions:

### Option A: Add Nginx Proxy (Recommended)
Add proxy rules to the webapp's nginx to forward `/auth/*` and `/rest/*` to port 3001:

```nginx
location /auth/ {
    proxy_pass http://217.154.211.42:3001/auth/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

### Option B: Update Build Configuration  
Rebuild the frontend with proper environment variables that ensure absolute URLs are used.

### Option C: Use Port 8080 Instead
Since the port 8080 webapp works correctly, redirect users there instead of port 80.

## Current Status:

- **Port 3001 API**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Port 8080 webapp**: ✅ Working with authentication
- **Port 80 webapp**: ❌ Browser URL resolution issue

## Recommendation:

**Use the working webapp on port 8080** (`http://217.154.211.42:8080`) until the proxy configuration can be properly implemented without breaking the container.

The authentication system itself is **100% working** - it's just a URL routing issue for the port 80 access method.
