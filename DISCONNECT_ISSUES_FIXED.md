# Disconnection Issues - Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed ✅

### 1. **Aggressive Health Check Polling** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Health check script was polling endpoints too frequently without timeouts
**Location**: `/opt/webapp-stack/infrastructure/scripts/health-check.sh`
**Solution Applied**:
- Added proper timeouts (5-10 seconds) and retry logic
- Spaced out health checks with sleep intervals (1-2 seconds between checks)
- Reduced connection pressure on webapp endpoints

### 2. **Frontend React Component Polling** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: React components were aggressively polling Supabase backend

**Personalization.tsx**:
- **Before**: Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- **After**: Auto-refresh every 5 minutes (10x reduction)

**ScrapingJobs.tsx**:
- **Before**: Auto-refresh every 10 seconds for running jobs  
- **After**: Auto-refresh every 60 seconds (6x reduction)

### 3. **N8n Webhook Service Timeouts** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Short timeouts and aggressive retries were causing connection churn
**Solution Applied**:
- Increased timeout from 15s to 30s
- Reduced retries from 2 to 1 attempt
- Added request debouncing (minimum 1 second between requests)
- Increased retry delays from 1s to 3s progressive intervals

### 4. **Port 80 Authentication Proxy** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Webapp on port 80 couldn't make API calls due to browser URL resolution
**Solution Applied**:
- Implemented nginx proxy configuration in `lead-dashboard` container
- Added proxy rules for `/auth/`, `/rest/`, and `/realtime/` endpoints
- Configured proper Host headers for Kong API gateway communication
- Webapp now works correctly on port 80 with authentication

## Technical Details

### Connection Reduction Impact:
- **Health checks**: Reduced from continuous polling to spaced intervals
- **Frontend polling**: Reduced by 6-10x frequency
- **Webhook requests**: Added debouncing and longer timeouts
- **Total connection reduction**: Estimated 80-90% fewer concurrent connections

### Nginx Proxy Configuration:
```nginx
# Proxy Supabase API calls through Kong gateway
location /auth/ {
    proxy_pass http://217.154.211.42:8000/auth/;
    proxy_set_header Host 217.154.211.42:8000;
}

location /rest/ {
    proxy_pass http://217.154.211.42:8000/rest/;
    proxy_set_header Host 217.154.211.42:8000;
}
```

## Result ✅
- Webapp accessible on port 80: `http://217.154.211.42/`
- Authentication endpoints working through proxy
- Massive reduction in connection overhead
- Disconnect issues should be resolved

## Testing Status
- ✅ Webapp loads correctly on port 80
- ✅ Auth API proxy responding properly
- ✅ REST API proxy responding properly
- ✅ Nginx configuration valid and loaded
- ✅ Connection polling reduced to reasonable intervals

The disconnection issues have been comprehensively addressed through connection optimization across all layers of the application stack.
